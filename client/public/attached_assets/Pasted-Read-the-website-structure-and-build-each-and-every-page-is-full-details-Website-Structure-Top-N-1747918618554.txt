Build a website for The C-Suite Leadership Development Program for Deep-Tech Ventures is a pioneering executive education initiative aimed at shaping the next generation of business leaders within Hong Kong’s deep-tech ecosystem. Unlike traditional accelerator programs or startup bootcamps, this program is specifically built for scientists, engineers, and tech founders who are stepping into leadership roles such as CEO, CTO, or other CXO positions—but may lack formal business training.

Developed by the Deep-Tech Lab in collaboration with the Centre for Entrepreneurship (CfE) and other leading academic institutions, and offered through ORKTS, this program addresses one of the biggest challenges in commercializing deep-tech: the gap between technical expertise and business leadership. Participants will undergo intensive training in commercialization, go-to-market strategy, business modeling, fundraising, and team leadership—all within the unique context and constraints of deep-tech ventures.

Delivered over four key sessions using a hybrid format (two in-person and two online), the program combines academic insight, investor perspectives, and lived experience from successful deep-tech founders and CXOs. Through workshops, case studies, and collaborative simulations, participants will gain not only knowledge but also access to a strong peer network and mentor community.

The program is especially relevant for ventures looking to scale from proof-of-concept (Phase 0) to early commercialization (Phase 1), and for institutional partners like ORKTS aiming to nurture high-potential tech spinouts. With limited slots available, participants are nominated through ORKTS and supported partially by institutional funding to keep the program accessible.

In short, this is more than a leadership course—it's a catalytic experience designed to build deep-tech-ready C-Suites, strengthen Hong Kong’s innovation pipeline, and unlock the commercial potential of frontier technologies.llow the website structure to build me each and every page of the website and make sure it is mobile responsive.
