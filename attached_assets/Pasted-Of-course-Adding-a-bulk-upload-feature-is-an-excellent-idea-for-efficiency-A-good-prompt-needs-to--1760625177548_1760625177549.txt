Of course. Adding a bulk-upload feature is an excellent idea for efficiency. A good prompt needs to be very specific about the backend process, especially how the data from the file columns maps to the website's content fields.

Here is the updated, more comprehensive prompt that includes the new `/uploadcompanies` page and its functionality.

### The Complete Prompt to Use

You can copy and paste the following text into your AI website builder:

```
I need to add a new "Ventures" section to my existing website and an admin page to upload new companies. Please follow these four steps:

**1. Update the Navigation Bar:**
Add a new link to the main navigation bar. The text for this link should be "Ventures".

**2. Create the Main Ventures Page:**
When a user clicks on the "Ventures" link in the navigation bar, it should take them to a new page at the URL `/ventures`. This page should have the following features:
* A main heading that says "Our Ventures".
* Below the heading, display a grid of portfolio companies.
* Each company must be displayed in a modern, clean "card" style.
* Each card should show the venture's name and a brief one-sentence value proposition.
* The cards must be sorted alphabetically by the venture's name.
* Each entire card must be a clickable link that navigates to that specific venture's detail page.

**3. Create a Template for Individual Venture Pages:**
When a user clicks on any venture card, it should open a new page dedicated to that specific venture (e.g., /ventures/venture-name). Create a template for these pages that includes the following sections and information fields. Use the "Nexodata" information below as the example content for the template.

---
**Venture Name:** (e.g., Nexodata)
**Website:** (e.g., www.nexodata.io - this should be a clickable link)
**HKDTL Cohort:** (e.g., 2023-24)
**University KTO:** (e.g., Chinese University of Hong Kong)
**Venture Value Proposition:** (A paragraph of text)
**Tech IP:** (A text block for IP status)
**Founders' Background:** (A text block for founder bios)
**Seeking Stakeholders:**
* Implement an interactive section with checkboxes for: [ ] Investors, [ ] Customers, [ ] Distribution Partners, [ ] Tech Partners, [ ] Hiring.
* Below the checkboxes, display a text line that lists out only the selected options. For example: "Seeking: Investors / Customers".
**Why Now?** (A text block for a short phrase)
---

**4. Create an Admin Page for Bulk Uploading Companies:**
Create a new, hidden page at the URL `/uploadcompanies`. This page should not be visible in the main navigation bar. This page will be used to upload company data in bulk.

* **Frontend UI:**
    * The page should have a clear heading like "Upload Company Data".
    * Include a file input field that allows an admin to select a CSV or Excel file from their computer.
    * Add an "Upload" button to submit the file.

* **Backend Logic:**
    * When the file is uploaded, the backend must be able to parse the data from the CSV or Excel file.
    * The backend should expect the file to have the following column headers: `Venture Name`, `Website`, `HKDTL Cohort`, `University KTO`, `Venture Value Proposition`, `Tech IP`, `Founders Background`, `Seeking Stakeholders`, `Why Now`.
    * For **each row** of data in the file, the system must automatically:
        1.  Create a new, individual venture page using the template from Step 3, populating it with the data from that row.
        2.  Add a new corresponding venture card to the main `/ventures` page (from Step 2).
        3.  Ensure the new card on the `/ventures` page links correctly to the newly created individual venture page.
    * After the upload process is complete, display a success message on the `/uploadcompanies` page, such as "Successfully uploaded and created [X] new company pages." If there's an error, it should report the issue (e.g., "Error: File format is incorrect. Please check the column headers.").

Please generate these pages and link them together as described.
